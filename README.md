# Iosevka Aeon

My customized version of [Iosekva](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka).

## Variants

Normal, SemiCondensed, and Condensed widths are available for all variants.

### Monospaced

The monospaced variant, Iosevka Aeon Nerd Font, is intended for use in terminals, text editors, IDEs, etc. It has been patched with all [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) icons using their [font patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts?tab=readme-ov-file#font-patcher).

This variant uses FontConfig monospacing, so most terminal emulators should automatically detect it.

### Quasi-proportional

The quasi-proportional variant, Iosevka Aeon Aile, is intended for regular body text, such as in documents or notes.

## Use

Download the TTF files you want and install them as system fonts by the normal font installation process for your OS.

Currently only TTF use is supported. WOFF support is planned.

## Inspiration

I chose the letterforms of this custom variant to match [FF Letter Gothic Mono](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/letter-gothic-mono-font-fontfont), as closly as possible, with three intentional deviations:

1. Lowercase `l`: A rightward serif has been added to the base. This further distinguishes the letter `l` from the numeral `1`.
2. Uppercase `J`: The leftward serif on the ascender has been removed. This makes `J` more harmonious with the other more minimalist uppercase letters.
3. Numeral `1`: The symmetric serifs at the base have been removed. This was just a personal preference and may be revised in future builds.
