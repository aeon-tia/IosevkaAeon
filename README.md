# Aeon Font

My customized version of [Iosekva](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka).

## Variants

Regular, SemiCondensed, and Condensed widths are available for all variants.

### Monospaced

The monospaced variant, is intended for use in terminals, text editors, IDEs, etc. A Nerd Font version Aeon Mono, Aeon Mono Nerd Font, is also available, which has been patched with all [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) icons using their [font patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts?tab=readme-ov-file#font-patcher).

### Quasi-proportional

The quasi-proportional variant, Iosevka Aeon Aile, is intended for regular body text, such as in documents or notes.

## Use

Download the TTF files you want and install them as system fonts by the normal font installation process for your OS.

If you'd like to build the fonts yourself, you can use the included `private-build-plans.toml` and follow the [custom build instructions](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/main/doc/custom-build.md) to do so.

## Inspiration

I chose the letterforms of this custom variant to match [FF Letter Gothic Mono](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/letter-gothic-mono-font-fontfont).
